It comprises a library of Go language functions for experimenting with
regular expressions and some associated command-line Unix utilities.
It implements the regex.cs.arizona.edu website.

This is primarily a research project, so there is no separate formal
documentation.  Library functions have comments designed for use with
the godoc utility.  Utility programs are also documented with comments
which in this case are most easily viewed in a text editor.
