Some notes about the RX code
[ 22-Mar-2014 / gmt ]

This file is a dumping place for random thoughts to help understand
and navigate the code.  See also the TODO file, which is an even more
cryptic collection of half-baked thoughts about future directions.


PACKAGE ORGANIZATION
The main package rx is for "library" type routines.
Subpackages rxr, rxd, etc implement command-level programs.
Most of the significant code should go in the library.
The programs should just provide an interface to the library.
(This rule is not entirely followed yet, e.g. rxd.) 

Library source files are perhaps too big and may get reorganized.
Programs are proliferating and I'm thinking about combining them.

VISIBILITY
[Recall: Capitalized symbols are exported from a package.]
Not everything capitalized should be considered an external "feature".
Some things are exported for access by debugging printfs in commands.
Parse tree node fields must all be exportable to be "gobbable".
Consequently, nearly everything is now exported.  This is not ideal.
