RX TO-DO LIST
(Things to consider)
(All items still remaining will probably not be done.)

REGEXPS:
Expand wildcards and classes to include Unicode
Add POSIX classes?
Add \b anchor? Embedded ^ and $?
Add flags such as "case insensitive"??
Other Perl stuff?

UTILITIES:
Handle newlines in exprs somehow?  
Add metadata to the JSON output of rxg
In rxcluster, subdivide large clusters

CLEANUP:
Add func for "canonizing" DFA (clearer output, easier testing)
Make gofmt pre-commit hook automatic in every Git clone
