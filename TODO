RX TO-DO LIST
(For consideration: not all of these are clear wins.)

Optimize the DFA minimization code -- slow8.rx
-- iterate over distinct input classes?

WEB APP:
Styling
Explanatory prose
Resource limit? (state count? replication max?)

REGEXPS:
Review Unicode situation
Revisit "invalid range" re weirdnesses like [\w-\.]
Is a{0,3}{0,3} parsed correctly?
Add POSIX classes?
Add \b anchor? Embedded ^ and $?
Add flags such as "case insensitive"??
Other Perl stuff?

UTILITIES:
Add metadata to the JSON output of rxg
In rxcluster, subdivide large clusters
Show WHICH pattern accepts on DOT output
Produce DOT for NFA, too
Combine multiple utilities into one (Swiss army knife)?

CLEANUP:
Add func for "canonizing" DFA (clearer output, easier testing)
Similarly for other ambiguous outputs e.g. protecting strings
Make everything Unicode safe?
Address #%#% annotations in code
Rework testing scheme to allow for command options
Make gofmt an automatic pre-commit hook
