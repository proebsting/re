(For consideration: not all of these are clear wins.)

WEB APP:
Styling
Explanatory prose
Resource limit? (state count? replication max?)

REGEXPS:
Expand wildcards and classes to include Unicode
Add POSIX classes?
Add \b anchor? Embedded ^ and $?
Add flags such as "case insensitive"??
Other Perl stuff?

UTILITIES:
Add metadata to the JSON output of rxg
In rxcluster, subdivide large clusters

CLEANUP:
Add func for "canonizing" DFA (clearer output, easier testing)
