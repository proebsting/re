RX TODO

Need to figure out exactly WHICH RE spec to follow

Fix both interpretation and display of '.'
Add "{n}?" ??
Add [^....] and \D \W \S
Add POSIX classes??
Add \b?  Other Perl stuff?
Add anchors (^....$)?  How?
etc etc

Figure out how to handle erroneous regexps

Fix #%#% items
Understand chars, bytes, and runes better
More consistency in use of pointers vs struct values
General code cleanup

Go-style tests

Use Git? Hg? 
Use Eclipse?
