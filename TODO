RX TO-DO LIST
(For consideration: not all of these are clear wins.)

Fix nondeterministic minimization of id#986!

Which pairs (& triples) of regexps combine most slowly?
(Why does rxcombos grow memory and thrash?  (60*rx, 2))
Optimize the DFA minimization code -- slow8.rx

WEB APP:
Add "diff" interface (2- & 3-way w/ Venn diagram)
Styling
Explanatory prose

REGEXPS:
Review Unicode situation
Revisit "invalid range" re weirdnesses like [\w-\.]
Is a{0,3}{0,3} parsed correctly?
Add POSIX classes?
Add \b anchor? Embedded ^ and $?
Add flags such as "case insensitive"??
Other Perl stuff?

UTILITIES:
Add metadata to the JSON output of rxg
In rxcluster, subdivide large clusters
Show WHICH pattern accepts on DOT output
Produce DOT for NFA, too
Combine multiple utilities into one (Swiss army knife)?

CLEANUP:
Remove all uints, just use ints?
Make everything Unicode safe?
Address #%#% annotations in code
Rework testing scheme to allow for command options
Make gofmt an automatic pre-commit hook
